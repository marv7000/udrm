# Contributing

This document explains how to format and submit contributions to
the `uDRM` project.

## General rules

- **NO** discriminatory behavior, everyone should be welcome to contribute.
- Every submission should solve exactly **ONE** problem.
- Your submission **MUST** be written by you.
- Your code **MUST** be licensed under the project's main license, or
  one that has less restrictions.

## Coding style

Try to mimic the style of the codebase. For convenience, use the `.clang-format`
file in the project root to check if your code is fit for submission.
